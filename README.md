# Recurrence Analysis -- Mystery Function

Analyze the running time of the following recursive procedure as a function of
$n$ and find a tight big $O$ bound on the runtime for the function. You may
assume that each operation takes unit time. You do not need to provide a formal
proof, but you should show your work: at a minimum, show the recurrence relation
you derive for the runtime of the code, and then how you solved the recurrence
relation.

```javascript
function mystery(n) {
    if(n <= 1)
        return;
    else {
        mystery(n / 3);
        var count = 0;
        mystery(n / 3);
        for(var i = 0; i < n*n; i++) {
            for(var j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                for(var k = 0; k < n*n; k++) {
                    count = count + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        mystery(n / 3);
    }
}
```

might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

since we call mystery(n/3) 3 times it runs n/3 times based on what n is we can assume that 
it would be $3T(n/3)$ and since the for loops will run n*n*n and we can apply that logic to 
the first for loop as well that makes it $n^5$ so if each opperation is unit time and its
added to mystery(n/3) then you would get $3T(n/3) + T(n^5)$.
